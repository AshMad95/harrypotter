Essential Harry Potter Knowledge
--------------------------------

Harry Potter is a seven book series, written by British novelist, J.K. Rowling, that was made into an eight movie franchise.
It is one of the biggest stories of the millennial generation; so if you haven’t heard of it, you’ve probably been living under
a rock. Many millennials read them when they came out as they were children, some watched the movies as they came out and then
read the book, while other only watched the movies. There have been over four hundred million copies sold around the world. The
movies made $7.7 billion when they were in theaters. Basically, it is a huge deal to a large number of people.
