Fanfiction
==========
Fanfiction, also called fic or fanfic, is what happens when fans love a story
so much that they decide to make it their own. Fanfiction has been around for
ages, but most likely became popular with the *Star Trek* fandom. The stories
were first circulated in 'fanzines' or just 'zines', essentially a magazine
of stories that were either sent to readers or sold at conventions. With the 
advent of the internet, fanfiction exploded, as it was even easier to share and
read works.

Fanfiction stories normally assume that the readers are aware of the existing 'canon', 
or the content of official works, and then create a story based on the canon. The extent
that the fanfic depends on the canon varies widely; some works expand on canon and others
only stick to canon only in the strictest sense, using similar characters or settings, 
but changing the content wildly. 

Like any genre, fanfiction has terms that are somewhat unique to its users. Here are just a few:

+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|           Term          |                    Definition                         | 
|                         |                                                       |         
+=========================+=======================================================+
|                         | A story that essentially just uses canon as a guide.  | 
| Alternate Universe (AU) | Often start from a "What If?" thought, such as        |
|                         | "What if Harry was a Slytherin?"                      |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|          Slash          | The story will have a pairing between two men.        |
|                         | The female equivalent is often called 'femslash'.     |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|     Crossover (Xover)   | The story "crosses over" with another fandom, using   |
|                         | content from both fandoms. Generally AU by default.   |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                         | Commonly held beliefs of fans that don't explicitly   |
|          Fanon          | contradict canon. For example, that the spell to tell |
|                         | time is 'tempus'.                                     |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                         | A relationship. Also used as a verb, as in "I ship    |
|                         | Harry and Hermione so hard", meaning "I *really* want |
|          Ship           | Harry and Hermione to form a relationship". Often     |
|                         | designated by a ship name, such as "Harmony" or a     |
|                         | slash between the two names: Harry/Hermione           |
