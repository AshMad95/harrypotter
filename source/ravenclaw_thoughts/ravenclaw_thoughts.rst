Thoughts on Ravenclaw
=====================
Ravenclaw are thought of as the smart ones. Befitting this stereotype, in order to get into the Ravenclaw common room, students
must solve a logical riddle, unlike the others which have passwords. The head of Ravenclaw at the time that Harry Potter is at
Hogwarts is Fillius Flitwick, the Charms professor. 

Ravenclaw Traits
----------------
According to the `Harry Potter wiki <http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ravenclaw>`_, Ravenclaws are known to be witty, creative,
have wisdom, and always be learning. They are very academically talented and motivated. Ravenclaws can also be very eccentric and
have unusual intellectual passions. Unlike Hufflepuff, Ravenclaws are said to be very competitive. This being because they want to
have the best grades in the class. They are often known to be backstabbers trying to achieve this goal. Ravenclaws are so
competitive that they go so far as to claim other very smart wizards even if they are in another house. Going along with their
competitiveness, Ravenclaw often has rivalry’s with the other houses at Hogwarts, in things other than quidditch.  In the 1994
*Triwizard Tournament*, Ravenclaws whole-heartedly supported Cedric Diggory and most of them went so far as to believe that Harry
Potter had cheated his way into the tournament.
