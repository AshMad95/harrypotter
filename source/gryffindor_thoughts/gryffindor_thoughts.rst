Thoughts on Gryffindor
======================
Gryffindor is thought to be the best house in all of Hogwarts. Why is that though? This might be because the majority of the members of the *Order of the Phoenix* and *Dumbledore’s Army* were also members of Gryffindor. Because of a sense of heroism of Gryffindors, they always seem to be favored over students in the other houses. 

Gryffindor Traits
-----------------
According to the `Harry Potter wiki <http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gryffindor>`_, Gryffindors are known to be courageous, chivalrous, and determined. They are seen as brave students who will break the rules if it is for the right reasons. Because of this, they are also sometimes seen as reckless, arrogant, and self-righteous. Most Gryffindors though, tend to be seen as heroes.  They do what is right and don’t think twice about it. These traits and the past between the founders of each house, lead to a fierce rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin.
