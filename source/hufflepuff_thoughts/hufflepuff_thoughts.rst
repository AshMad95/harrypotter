Thoughts on Hufflepuff
======================

Hufflepuffs get a bit of a bad rep. Not only are they seldom mentioned in the 
books (Fun fact: Hufflepuff's common room is the only one Harry didn't visit),
but they are thought to be the house of the leftovers. As a proud 'puff, I 
feel I need to rectify this outdated view. So, in the words on A Very Potter
Musical's Dumbledore, "What the hell is a Hufflepuff?"

Hufflepuff Traits
----------
According to the `Harry Potter wiki <http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hufflepuff>`_, 
Hufflepuffs are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, and honest. Hufflepuff
value fair play, patience, kindness, and tolerance. Due to this, Hufflepuff is 
probably the most inclusive house, as they do not place an emphasis on a 
particular aptitude. These valued traits may also cause Hufflepuffs to be less 
competitive and more modest about their accomplishments, leading to poorer 
performance in the House Cup and thus a reputation of hosting the less 
talented wizards and witches. 

Famous Hufflepuffs

  She died at the Battle of Hogwarts.
