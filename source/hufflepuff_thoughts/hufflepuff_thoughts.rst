Thoughts on Hufflepuff
======================
Hufflepuffs get a bit of a bad rep. Not only are they seldomly mentioned in the books (Fun fact: Hufflepuff's common room is the only one Harry didn't visit), but they are thought to be the house of the leftovers. As a proud 'puff, I feel I need to rectify this outdated view. So, in the words on A Very Potter Musical's Dumbledore, "What the hell is a Hufflepuff?"

The Traits
----------
According to the `Harry Potter wiki <http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hufflepuff>`_, Hufflepuffs are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, and honest. Hufflepuff value fair play, patience, kindness, and tolerance. Due to this, Hufflepuff is probably the most inclusive house, as they do not place an emphasis on a particular aptitude. These valued traits may also cause Hufflepuffs to be less competitive and more modest about their accomplishments, leading to poorer performance in the House Cup and thus a reputation of hosting the less talented wizards and witches.
