Thoughts on Slytherin
=====================

Slytherins are thought to be 'evil' and minions of the Dark. Whilst this is true
for a select few Slytherins, it would be misguided to believe this of every 
Slytherin. Do people really believe that the Sorting Hat looks into the mind 
of an eleven-year-old and thinks "Ah yes, true darkness lies within this child. 
Better put them into the House of **EVIL**!" So, what makes a Slytherin?

Slytherin Traits
---------------- 
According to the `Harry Potter wiki <http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Slytherin>`_,
Slytherins are known for their resourcefulness, cunning, ambition, and determination. 
They also have a very strong sense of self-preservation. They think before they act, 
unlike the majority of their Gryffindor rivals. None of these traits are inherently
evil. Perhaps a child was sorted into to Slytherin because they want to find a cure
for Lycanthropy, a rather ambitious goal that would require loads of determination
and resourcefulness to complete. Who would think this child to be inherently dark?
After all, Harry Potter himself was almost a Slytherin, likely in part due to his
treatment at the Dursley's. Maybe some of the young Snakes are there due to rough
home lives- they have to be resourceful and possess a strong sense of self-preservation
just to survive. Essentially, just because someone was a Slytherin does not imply
an inherent darkness within. 

Famous Slytherins
-----------------
Sure, Tom Riddle and the Death Eaters were mostly Slytherins- after all, where better 
to recruit minions than your own house? - but there were also a number of truly great
Slytherins. 

* **Merlin** - Yes, that Merlin. Often thought to be one of the greatest wizards of all
  time, he was also an advocate for Muggle rights.

  brave things that resulted in the end of the War. He also very an accomplished Potions
  Master and the Slytherin Head of House.

  destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.
