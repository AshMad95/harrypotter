The wizarding school that is the most prominent in the books and movies is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In every book and movie except
movie seven, the main characters are at Hogwarts. Hogwarts has four houses that are named after the founders of the school, Godric Gryffindor, Rowena 
Ravenclaw, Salazar Slytherin, and Helga Hufflepuff. The school’s motto is *Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus*, which means “Never tickle a sleeping
dragon.” The coat of arms bares this motto and also the animal of each house, as seen below.

In the fourth book/movie *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and Durmstrang Institute appear. In the movie, Beauxbatons
in an all-girl school and Durmstrang is an all-boy school. However, in the books both school are co-educational.

The only school left, is mentioned in the prequel and spinoff of Harry Potter, *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*. There isn’t much information
in the movie about it other than the fact that it is located in the United States of America.
