Spells of Harry Potter
======================

	There are many spells featured in the Harry Potter series. Each
wizard has a wand that can be used to cast these spells. There are a 
few recognizable names, but it is difficult to remember all of the 
spells off the top of your head. There are spells for just about anything 
you could imagine. Spells range from battle spells, to spells that will 
just make you laugh because they are ridiculous. Here are some of the 
main spells and what effects they have. 

==================  ==================================================
The Spells          Effects
==================  ==================================================

------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Lumos               Creates a light
------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Expecto Patronum    Gets rid of the Dementors by summoning a Patronus
------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Expelliarmus        Disarms the wizard it hits
------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Alohomora           The spell used by Hermione to unlock all the doors
==================  ==================================================

	These are most of the main spells that are used in the story of
Harry Potter. Some were used more than others, but some were used in 
very important moments. Every single battle all you that was ever said
was "Expelliarmus, Expelliarmus, Expelliarmus". A personal favorite of
mine has always been Wingardium Leviosa. Levitation has always fascinated
me. So making it happen by just pointing a wand at it is just amazing.
