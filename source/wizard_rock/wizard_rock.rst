Wizard Rock
===========
Wizard Rock, also called Wrock, began in 2002 with *Harry and the Potters*, 
a band created by brothers Joe and Paul DeGeorge. Wrock is essentially any song
that revolves around Harry Potter, creating a wide variety of stylings. The songs may be
written as though they are sung from the perspective of a character, such as the music of 
*The Remus Lupins*, a commentary about the Harry Potter community, such as many of the 
songs from Hank Green, or may be a form of fan activism, commenting on social issues
through the lens of Harry Potter, such as many of the songs by *Harry and the Potters*. 

Though the numbers have waned since the peak of the Harry Potter fandom, there are still
many bands and artists that perform Wrock, such as *Harry and the Potters* and Hank Green. 
As for the rest, their music is still widely available thanks to the wonders of the internet. 
Here are a few of my favorites.

*The Remus Lupins*
------------------
This band split in 2007, but their music is still around. The songs are sung from the
perspective of Remus Lupin, werewolf, DADA teacher, Order Member, and friend of James
Potter. They have a lot of great songs, but this one in particular really gets to me:

*Oliver Boyd and the Remembralls*
---------------------------------
This band was created in 2006 by Toronto-based musician Christian Caldeira, 
who no longer performs. His music tends to be a mix of commentary about the 
series and the fandom and songs about the story and themes of Harry Potter. 
He also has a wide range of styles, from ballads to harder rock. This is one
of his more 'rockier' songs.

*Gred and Forge*
----------------
This band's songs are from the perspective of the Weasley Twins, Fred and George. 
Most of the songs are pretty upbeat and a bit mischievous, much like the characters,
but they have a few absolutely devastating songs, due to their unfortunate fate. I'll spare
you the pain and share a fun song.

*The Ministry of Magic*
-----------------------
Though they no longer perform, this band was originally based out of Ames, Iowa. Their songs
are generally focused on elements taken from the stories and occasionally take the perspective
of a single character. They also have a wide range of styles; this ballad is from the perspective
of Harry, and possibly Tom Riddle and is quite wonderful.

*Team Starkid*
--------------
Though not a Wrock band per se, they did produce a series of Harry Potter parody musicals. The troupe,
based out of Chicago and formed at the University of Michigan, still performs, 
but have since moved on to other focuses.

Hank Green
----------
Hank, the brother of author John Green, performs a number of songs on their mutual YouTube channel
vlogbrothers. Though he has many, many songs not related to Harry Potter, his first popular
song was  "Accio Deathly Hallows", released just before *Deathly Hallows*. He is currently
part of the band *Hank Green and the Perfect Strangers* and does a number of educational
channels with his brother, such as Crash Course. He has a number of great, semi-educational/
fun sciencey songs, but this is his most recent Harry Potter song (there's also a more acoustic version).
