Quidditch
=========

Quidditch is the sport that Harry Potter and the other characters
play. You play the whole game riding on a broomstick flying in the air
like a true wizard. The game involves seven players, three chasers, two
beaters, one keeper, and one seeker. There are also four balls in play.
A quaffle, two bludgers, and a golden snitch. Chasers are in charge of
getting the quaffle and throwing it through the hoop in order to score 
points. Beaters are the defenders of quidditch. Beaters use bludgers
to keep the opposing chasers from holding the quaffle. The keeper is the
goal keeper who trys to stop the chasers from scoring. The seeker must
catch the golden snitch, which is released in the middle of a match. 
Once the golden snitch is caught, that team receives 150 points and the 
match is over. Most games whoever catches the golden snitch wins the game.

In Harry's first match, he is the seeker for Gryffindor. He has an
intense battle with the other seeker. With a flash of flair, by standing
on his broom stick and diving off the end of it, he catches the golden
snitch in his mouth to secure the victory for his house.
